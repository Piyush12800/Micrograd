# Micrograd Jupyter Notebook

This Jupyter Notebook contains the implementation of Micrograd, a lightweight autograd library inspired by PyTorch. Micrograd allows you to compute gradients for functions using automatic differentiation. It is designed for educational purposes and small-scale projects.

## Getting Started

To use Micrograd in your Jupyter Notebook, follow the steps below:

1. Download the `micrograd.ipynb` notebook file from the repository.
2. Open Jupyter Notebook on your local machine or an online Jupyter environment.
3. Upload the `micrograd.ipynb` notebook file to your Jupyter Notebook workspace.
4. Run the notebook cells to execute the code and interact with Micrograd.

## Dependencies

Micrograd relies on the Graphviz library for visualizing computation graphs. To use the graph visualization functionality, you need to install Graphviz and its Python interface. Follow the instructions below to install Graphviz:

### Install Graphviz (Windows)

1. Download the Graphviz installer from the official website: https://graphviz.org/download/.
2. Run the installer and follow the on-screen instructions to complete the installation.
3. Add the Graphviz `bin` directory to your system's `PATH` environment variable. The default installation path is `C:\Program Files\Graphviz\bin`.

### Install Graphviz (macOS)

1. Open a terminal.
2. Install Graphviz using Homebrew by running the following command:

   ```bash
   $ brew install graphviz
   ```

### Install Graphviz (Linux)

1. Open a terminal.
2. Install Graphviz using the package manager for your Linux distribution. For example, on Ubuntu, run the following command:

   ```bash
   $ sudo apt-get install graphviz
   ```

## Usage

The notebook provides an example of how to use Micrograd to compute gradients for a simple function. It demonstrates the basic operations and syntax used in Micrograd. You can modify the code and experiment with different functions and operations.
